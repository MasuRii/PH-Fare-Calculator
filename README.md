**PH Fare Calculator** is a cross-platform mobile application designed to help tourists, expats, and locals estimate public transport costs across the Philippines.

Unlike city-centric navigation apps, this tool focuses on **"How much?"** rather than "How to?". It solves the complex problem of Philippine geography by combining distance-based formulas (for roads) with static fare matrices (for trains and ferries).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Nationwide Coverage:** Works in Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, and rural provinces.
- **Modular Offline Maps:** Download maps by island group (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao) to save storage space while ensuring functionality without internet.
- **Material 3 Design:** A completely redesigned UI/UX that follows modern Material Design guidelines for better accessibility and aesthetics.
- **Hybrid Calculation Engine:**
  - **Dynamic:** Uses **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)** to calculate road distance for Jeeps, Taxis, Buses, and Tricycles.
  - **Static:** Uses embedded Lookup Tables for fixed-price modes like MRT/LRT (Trains) and Ferries.
- **"Fair Price" Indicator:** Provides a visual "Traffic Level" and price classification (Standard, Peak, Tourist Trap) to help users gauge reasonable fares.
- **Multi-Mode Support:**
  - **Road:** Jeepney (Traditional/Modern), Bus (Ordinary/Aircon), Taxi, UV Express, Tricycle, Pedicab.
  - **Rail:** LRT-1, LRT-2, MRT-3, PNR.
  - **Water:** Ferries.
- **Smart Filtering:** "Provincial" mode toggle that adjusts fare calculation logic (e.g., 20% variance for provincial routes).
- **Offline Reference:** View saved routes and static fare matrices (Cheat Sheets) without an internet connection using **Hive** local storage.
- **Discount Support:** Built-in support for Student, Senior Citizen, and PWD discounts (20% off).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter & Dart
- **State Management & DI:** `injectable` + `get_it` for dependency injection.
- **Routing:** **OSRM** (Open Source Routing Machine) for road distances.
- **Geocoding:** **OpenStreetMap (Nominatim)** via `http` for place search and reverse geocoding.
- **Offline Maps:** `flutter_map_tile_caching` for downloading and storing map regions.
- **Connectivity:** `connectivity_plus` for smart online/offline network detection.
- **Local Storage:** `hive` for persisting saved routes and `shared_preferences` for user settings.
- **Maps:** `flutter_map` with `latlong2`.

## 🧮 How It Works (The Hybrid Engine)

The Philippines has a fragmented transport pricing system. This app handles it using two methods via the `HybridEngine`:

### 1. Formula-Based (Road)
Used for **Jeepneys, Buses, Taxis, UV Express, Tricycles**.
> `Fare = Base Fare + ((OSRM Distance * 1.15) * Per KM Rate)`

*   **Why 1.15?** Public transport routes are rarely as direct as private car routes. We add a 15% variance factor to OSRM's output to approximate real-world travel conditions and deviations.
*   **Provincial Variance:** A 20% multiplier is applied to specific modes (like Jeepneys) when the "Provincial" toggle is enabled in settings.

### 2. Matrix-Based (Fixed)
Used for **MRT, LRT, PNR, and Ferries**.
Distance formulas fail here (e.g., Rail distance ≠ Road distance).
> `Fare = Database lookup [Origin_Station] -> [Dest_Station]`

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MasuRii/ph-fare-calculator.git
    cd ph-fare-calculator
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash

    ```

4.  **Run the App**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app provides **estimates only**. Official fares are regulated by the LTFRB/DOTr and are subject to change without notice. This app is not affiliated with any government agency. The "Tourist Trap" indicator is an estimate based on high-traffic pricing models and does not constitute a legal accusation.
